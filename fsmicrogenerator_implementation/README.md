    *   **Account Management:** Handles users, roles, permissions (RBAC), and authentication.
    *   **Technical Configuration:** Manages dynamic menus and internationalization settings.
    *   **Taxonomy:** Structures and classifies content.



## ‚ú® Fundamental Principles

This generated application adheres to core design principles:

*   **Microservices & Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Services are decomposed around specific business domains.
*   **RESTful APIs:** Backend services expose APIs following REST principles (See Figure 2).
*   **Asynchronous & Synchronous Communication:** Uses RabbitMQ for both event-driven (Pub/Sub) and request/reply (RPC) patterns.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** Clear distinction between frontend, backend, gateway, and infrastructure.
*   **Configuration Management:** Global and service-specific configuration handling.
*   **Containerization:** Encapsulating services using Docker.

*   **Orchestration:** Docker Compose handles the setup and linking of all services.
*   **Instructions:** Refer to the Docker Compose files and environment variable templates for detailed deployment steps.

## ü¶ä CI/CD Pipeline with Integrated DevSecOps (GitLab)

A robust CI/CD pipeline, defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, automates the build, security scanning, testing, and deployment lifecycle, embedding security practices throughout (**DevSecOps**).

**Pipeline Stages:** `install` ‚ûî `test` ‚ûî `build` ‚ûî `security` ‚ûî `deploy` ‚ûî `notify` ‚ûî `cleanup`

**Workflow:**

1.  **On Every Commit (All Branches):**
    *   `install`: Installs NPM dependencies.
    *   `test`: Executes automated tests (Jest), generating reports.
    *   `security (Partial)`: Integrates automated security scans using GitLab templates and custom tools that run on all branches:
        *   **GitLab Native Scans:** SAST, Dependency Scanning, Secret Detection.
        *   **IaC Security Scan (Checkov):** Scans infrastructure-as-code files.
        *(Note: These scans provide early feedback on potential issues.)*

2.  **On Commit to `main` Branch Only:**
    *   `build`: Builds and pushes versioned Docker images to the GitLab Container Registry.
    *   `security (Container Scan)`: Performs **Container Scanning** (GitLab Template & Custom Trivy) on the newly built images to detect vulnerabilities specifically within the container environment.
    *   `deploy`: Securely connects to the remote host (SSH), pulls the built and scanned images, and restarts the application using `docker-compose.prod.yml` (with backup/rollback).
    *   `notify`: Sends Slack notifications for deployment status and critical security alerts (from *all* scans, including container scanning).
    *   `cleanup`: Periodically removes old containers/images on the remote server.

**DevSecOps Highlights:**

*   üîí **Continuous Security:** Security scans (SAST, Dependency, Secret, IaC) run on *every commit* for early feedback.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Pre-Deployment Gate:** Container scanning runs specifically on the `main` branch *after build* but *before deployment*, acting as a crucial check on the final artifacts.
*   üîë **Comprehensive Scanning:** Covers static code, dependencies, secrets, infrastructure configuration, and container images.
*   üì¢ **Integrated Alerting:** Immediate Slack notifications for critical security findings from any scan stage.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

Two primary methods exist for running this project locally:

**Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)**

*   **Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose installed.
*   **Configuration:** Review/create `.env` files for different environments (`.env`, `.env.dev`, `.env.test`). Pay attention to production settings in `docker-compose.prod.yml`.
*   **Run:** Use Docker Compose to build and start all services. For production:
    ```bash
    # Ensure you have configured .env
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
    ```

**Option 2: Local Services (Manual Setup)**

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (v >= 18)
